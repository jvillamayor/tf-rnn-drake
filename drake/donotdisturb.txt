Do Not Disturb
Full lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano
Black red bandana, oh, a trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run, don't
