Skepta Interlude
Hey girl
Do you want my number
That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I dont expect nothin at all
Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
Or if I dont call you back
Prove you right
Or this last
Just one night
(maybe we should slow it down)
Slow slow slow

Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
Or if I dont call you back
Prove you right
Or this last
Just one night
(maybe we should slow it down)
