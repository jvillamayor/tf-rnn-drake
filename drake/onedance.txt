One Dance
I need a one dance
I need a one dance

Grips on your waist, front way, back way, you know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away, even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece, I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
I need a one dance
I need a one dance
I need a one dance

Strength and guidance, all that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends, I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me, soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting, we've got no time

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
I need a one dance
I need a one dance
I need a one dance
