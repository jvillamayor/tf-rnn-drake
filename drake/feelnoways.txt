Feel No Ways
I just popped a couple pillies and I’m feeling sane
Got nobody else but you, and you be out my way
She gon love me, when she want to, I can’t do the same
I been hurting way too long and I still feel the same

Chill with you
Chill with you
Chill with you
Chilling at the palace we don’t talk, my feelings blue
Spending all this time, they chasing diamonds, I been chasing you
Girl you know I ain’t got feelings for nobody else but you
Used to pull up on my ex even when she had a man
Used to write a couple letters when she made me mad
Diamonds dancing Fiji water I just made a band
I ain’t never looking back now I’m on stimulants

I just popped a couple pillis and I’m feeling sane
Got nobody else but you, and you be out my way
She gon love me, when she want to, I can’t do the same
I been hurting way too long and I still feel the same

Neck faucet drippy, I got all this ice
Diamonds dancing on me, if you love me, treat you right
You can’t stop the wishing girl you know the feeling right
When you see me walking in the club, I know you tight
My team scoring, can’t ignore it, whipping foreign
Back to back, I’m winning gotta get like Michael Jordan
80 on the board, I’ll fly you out if you important
Turn your life around when you with me, they can’t ignore it

I just popped a couple pillies and I’m feeling sane
Got nobody else but you, and you be out my way
She gon love me, when she want to, I can’t do the same
I been hurting way too long and I still feel the same
I just popped a couple pillies
Now I’m feeling partly
Got nobody else but you and you be on safari
Wish that I could hurt you like you hurt me at the party
You still hit my line but I dont really need your sorry

I just popped a couple pillies and I’m feeling sane
Got nobody else but you, and you be out my way
She gon love me, when she want to, I can’t do the same
I been hurting way too long and I still feel the same
